To-Do List
==========

Features
--------
* *Persistence*: Implement user accounts. Users can maintain a to-listen list from their account.
    * Can possibly expand accounts to try and recommend similar artists -- hook in to Last.fm's similar artists feature?
    * Should users be able to get recommendations without having an account?
* *Information*: Spotify links, official YouTube channel links, etc.

Bug Fixes
---------
* Remove RYM scraper until they have their own API.
* Handle Unicode characters in artist and album names.

Front-Endy Stuff
----------------
* Make a less-1995-looking page.
* Somehow use AJAX to get album recs and manage the to-listen list on the fly?

Organization/Logistic Stuff
---------------------------
* Create a dedicated `scripts` folder.
